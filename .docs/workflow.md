The software automated software pipeline(s).

### Introduction
The current platform of choice to run workflows on is GitHub Workflows. See the GitHib Workflow file(s) in `<REPO_ROOT>/.github/workflows`.

## Workflows
### Containerization
This workflow simply builds a Dockerfile in the repository root and push it to the correct image in Docker Hub based on the environment variables specified on the [Support & Contribute](./support_contribute.md) page. This workflow also updates that image's description to match that of our README.md file.
